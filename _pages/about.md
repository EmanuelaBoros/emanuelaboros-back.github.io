My work and research

My background
======

I received my Ph.D in 2018 from the University of Paris-Saclay, Paris, France, in computer science, in the field of natural language processing (NLP). My [work](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01943841/document) was based on the proposal of several neural networks for extracting events from unstructured text. Before, I obtained my M.A. in Software Engineering from the Alexandru I. Cuza University, Iasi, Romania, and my B.A. in Computer Science at the same university. 
I also obtained my M.A and B.A in arts (video & photography) from the George Enescu University, Iasi, Romania. 
During my Ph.D, for three years I've been at [CEA, List](http://www-list.cea.fr/en/) (Laboratory for Integration of Systems and Technology) and LIMSI (now [LISN](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/), Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Digital Sciences), both in Orsay, France. For the next year, I've been a research engineer at the Linear Accelerator Laboratory (joint research unit of the National Institute of Nuclear Physics and Particle Physics of the CNRS and the University of Paris-Saclay),
in the [Paris Saclay Center for Data Science](http://www.datascience-paris-saclay.fr/) context, where my work focused on NLP applications in French law (case outcome predictive analytics, etc.) and the detection of fake news. From 2017, I've worked as a machine learning scientist at [Teklia](https://teklia.com/) and focused on research and development of technologies for digitized/historical document understanding (handwriting recognition, article separation, named entity recognition).
From the beginning of 2020, I decided to return to the acadamic environement, and started a postdoctoral scholar position at the University of La Rochelle, in La Rochelle, France.
