Salut ! I'm Ema, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of La Rochelle, France, in the 
L3i Laboratory. 

I have a background in computer science and arts which means I can develop emotionally and intellectually engaging algorithms (i.e. works of art) and I can cause trouble in both fields.
I'm quite enthusiastic when it comes to participating in data science competitions and when I am not coding, my time is filled with a strong interest in cognitive science and history books, movies and TV series.

I go by the principle that talking less is more thinking and getting things done, thus I listen more than I talk.
My research and teaching are founded on the idea that science is an inherently social activity, where knowledge should be shared and not forced.


My work and research

My background
======

I received my Ph.D in 2018 from the University of Paris-Saclay, Paris, France, in computer science, in the field of natural language processing (NLP). My [work](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01943841/document) was based on the proposal of several neural networks for extracting events from unstructured text. Before, I obtained my M.A. in Software Engineering from the [Alexandru I. Cuza University, Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.uaic.ro/en/), Iasi, Romania, and my B.A. in Computer Science at the same university. 
I also obtained my M.A and B.A in arts (video & photography) from the [George Enescu National University of Arts](https://www.arteiasi.ro/?page_id=1144&lang=eng), Iasi, Romania. 

During my Ph.D, for three years I've been at [CEA, List](http://www-list.cea.fr/en/) (Laboratory for Integration of Systems and Technology) and LIMSI (now [LISN](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/), Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Digital Sciences), both in Orsay, France. For the next year, I've been a research engineer at the [LAL](https://www.lal.in2p3.fr/en/) (Linear Accelerator Laboratory),
in the [Paris Saclay Center for Data Science](http://www.datascience-paris-saclay.fr/) context, where my work focused on NLP applications in French law (case outcome predictive analytics, etc.) and the detection of fake news. 

From 2017, I've worked as a machine learning scientist at [Teklia](https://teklia.com/) and focused on research and development of technologies for digitized/historical document understanding (handwriting recognition, article separation, named entity recognition).

From the beginning of 2020, I decided to return to the academic environement, and started a postdoctoral scholar position at the University of La Rochelle, in La Rochelle, France.
