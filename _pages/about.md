Hello, I'm Ema, a [research scientist at DHLAB (Digital Humanities Laboratory) at EPFL](https://people.epfl.ch/emanuela.boros?lang=en) in Lausanne, Switzerland.

I have a computer science and art background, which means I can develop algorithmic works of art (joking - I might be funny also). I'm pretty enthusiastic about participating in data science competitions. When I am not coding, my time is filled with a strong interest in history books, movies, and TV series.

Generally, I go by the principle "talk less, listen more, get things done".

My background
======

I received my Ph.D. in 2018 from the [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), Paris, France, in computer science, in the field of natural language processing (NLP). My [thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01943841/document) was based on the proposal of several neural networks for extracting events from unstructured text. Before, I obtained my M.A. in Software Engineering from the [Alexandru I. Cuza University, Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.uaic.ro/en/), Iasi, Romania, and my B.A. in Computer Science at the same university. 
I also obtained my M.A and B.A in arts (video & photography) from the [George Enescu National University of Arts](https://www.arteiasi.ro/?page_id=1144&lang=eng), Iasi, Romania. 

During my PhD, for three years, I've been at [CEA, List](http://www-list.cea.fr/en/) (Laboratory for Integration of Systems and Technology) and LIMSI (now [LISN](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/), Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Digital Sciences), both in Orsay, France. For the next year, I've been a research engineer at the [LAL](https://www.lal.in2p3.fr/en/) (Linear Accelerator Laboratory),
in the [Paris Saclay Center for Data Science](http://www.datascience-paris-saclay.fr/) context, where my work focused on NLP applications in French law (case outcome predictive analytics, etc.) and the detection of fake news. 

From 2017 to the end of 2019, I worked as a machine learning scientist at [Teklia](https://teklia.com/) and focused on the research and development of technologies for digitised/historical document understanding (handwriting recognition, article separation, named entity recognition).

At the beginning of 2020, I decided to return to the academic environment. I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of La Rochelle in La Rochelle, France, in the [L3i](https://l3i.univ-larochelle.fr/?lang=en) (IT, Image and Interaction) Laboratory until the end of 2022. My main research interest is in information extraction (entities, relations, events, etc.) from historical (digitised) documents.
