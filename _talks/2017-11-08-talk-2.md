Being part of the [Paris Saclay Center for Data Science](http://www.datascience-paris-saclay.fr/) in 2016, I gave a [talk](https://indico.ijclab.in2p3.fr/event/4667/) regarding the organization of a Fake news RAMP (__Rapid Analytics and Model Prototyping__), which is a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)-style competition that encourages competition and cooperation between the participants. The [Fake News RAMP](https://ramp.studio/problems/fake_news) was about the classification of statements of public figures
and a starting kit [code](https://github.com/ramp-kits/fake_news) was also provided to the participants as a starting point.
