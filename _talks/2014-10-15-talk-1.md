I gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i_f675N8Ys) about word representations and event extraction at during season 2 (the second year) of [Paris Machine Learning Group](https://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2014/10/ce-soir-paris-machine-learning-2-season.html), in 2014. 
Now, the [group](http://parismlgroup.org/#about) is at their 8th season with a total of 120 episodes.
