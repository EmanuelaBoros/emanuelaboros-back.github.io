I gave a talk about word representations and event extraction at during season 2 (the second year) of [Paris Machine Learning Group](https://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2014/10/ce-soir-paris-machine-learning-2-season.html), in 2014. Now, the group is at their 8th season with a total of 120 episodes. More details [here](http://parismlgroup.org/#about).
